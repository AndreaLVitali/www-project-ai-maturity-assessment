# Welcome to the OWASP AI Maturity Assessment Project!

### Project description

With the growing interest and adoption of AI technologies, itâ€™s critical to establish a framework that organizations can use to measure and enhance their AI maturity levels.

In recent months, several AI Maturity Models have emerged, including the MITRE AI Framework, which highlights the need for structured AI assessments. Building on this momentum, we are developing the OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA), using the Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) as a foundation.

Mission Statement: The OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) aims to be the premier framework that enables organizations to assess, analyze, and improve the security and responsible usage of AI technologies. Like OWASP SAMM, AIMA will be technology and process agnostic, delivering a risk-driven approach that guides organizations in managing AI systems throughout their entire lifecycle.
