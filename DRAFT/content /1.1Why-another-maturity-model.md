# 1.1 Why another Maturity Model?

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of society and business, organizations face unique challenges that are not fully addressed by existing maturity models. While frameworks such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owaspsamm.org) provide valuable structures for assessing traditional software development processes, they lack the specificity needed to account for the distinct complexities of AI systems. This gap necessitates the creation of a specialized maturity model tailored to the unique demands of AI.

At OWASP we are working on several projects focusing on the security and privacy aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Notable among these are:

1.   **[OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-models/) **: This project educates stakeholders about potential security risks when deploying and managing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI applications. It provides resources, including a list of the top 10 most critical vulnerabilities often seen in LLM applications, such as prompt injections, data leakage, and unauthorized code execution. 
2. **[OWASP AI Security and Privacy Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/)**: This guide offers clear and actionable insights on designing, creating, testing, and procuring secure and privacy-preserving AI systems. It addresses both security and privacy aspects, providing guidance on how to handle AI-specific challenges.
3. **[OWASP AI Exchange](https://owaspai.org)**: 170+ pages of comprehensive guidance on how to protect AI and data-centric systems against security threats - feeding straight into international standards. Made by the community and provided as open source to the community. Part of the OWASP AI Security & privacy guide.
4. **[OWASP Machine Learning Security Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10)**: This project provides an overview of the top 10 security issues in machine learning systems. It covers both adversarial attacks and non-adversarial scenarios, such as security hygiene of machine learning operational and engineering workflows. 

These projects collectively aim to enhance the security and privacy of AI and ML systems by providing comprehensive guidelines, resources, and tools for developers, designers, architects, managers, and organizations. The AIMA project was born from the OWASP SAMM and OWASP AI initiatives.

## Addressing the unique challenges of AI

AI systems differ fundamentally from traditional software due to their reliance on data-driven models, adaptive behaviors, and often opaque decision-making processes. These characteristics introduce challenges such as:
* Skills Gap: organizations and users often lack the necessary expertise to manage AI systems effectively or to understand their functionality, limitations, and potential risks. This can lead to mismanagement or improper use of AI technologies, further exacerbating existing challenges.
* Ethical Dilemmas: AI systems must align with societal and organizational values, avoiding biases, discrimination, and harmful outcomes.
* Security Risks: AI is vulnerable to threats such as adversarial attacks, data poisoning, which require targeted security practices.
* Transparency and Accountability: The often "black-box" nature of AI models complicates efforts to ensure explainability and traceability.

## AI Software: a call for user awareness and organizational responsibility

Traditional software development relies on predefined rules and deterministic behaviors, making its functionality predictable and easier to test, validate, and govern. In contrast, AI systems operate on data-driven models that learn from large datasets and make probabilistic decisions, often exhibiting adaptive behaviors. This fundamental difference means that AI systems can behave unpredictably in new scenarios, are prone to biases based on the data they are trained on, and often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. Users interacting with AI systems may not fully understand their limitations, risks, or potential for error, leading to misuse or misplaced trust.

For companies, these differences pose significant challenges. Unlike traditional software that adheres to rigid specifications, AI systems require continuous monitoring and adaptation to ensure they remain aligned with business goals and ethical standards. Organizations may deploy AI without fully appreciating its operational risks, such as unfair outcomes, security vulnerabilities, or regulatory non-compliance. For example, a financial company might adopt an AI system for loan approvals without properly validating its training data, leading to biased decisions that could harm customers and damage the company’s reputation. This underscores the critical need for awareness, accountability, and governance among stakeholders to ensure AI is developed and deployed responsibly.

Existing maturity models do not comprehensively address these factors, leaving organizations without adequate guidance for responsibly managing the development, deployment, and oversight of AI systems.

## Bridging Principles and Practice

In recent months, several AI Maturity Models have emerged, including the MITRE AI Framework, which highlights the need for structured AI assessments. However, these high-level principles often fail to provide actionable steps for organizations. 

The AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) seeks to bridge this gap by:
* Translating abstract ethical principles into practical, measurable actions.
* Offering a structured approach to implementing governance, security, fairness, and sustainability in AI projects.
* Aligning organizational processes with emerging global standards and regulations.

## Supporting Organizations at All Stages of Maturity

AIMA will be designed to be adaptable like OWASP SAMM, supporting organizations at various stages of their AI journey—from those beginning to explore AI capabilities to those operating complex, large-scale AI systems. The model provides:
* Clear benchmarks for assessing current AI practices.
* Roadmaps for improvement tailored to organizational needs.
* A collaborative framework that integrates interdisciplinary input from technical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives.

By addressing the limitations of existing models and focusing on the unique challenges posed by AI, the AIMA provides a much-needed framework for organizations to responsibly harness the transformative potential of AI. This ensures not only compliance and risk mitigation but also the development of AI systems that are fair, transparent, and aligned with societal values.
