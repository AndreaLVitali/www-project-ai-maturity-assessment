## Data Quality and Integrity

### Introduction


In the context of AI readiness, data quality and data integrity are foundational pillars that determine the effectiveness, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI systems. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. High-quality data ensures that models learn meaningful patterns, produce accurate predictions, and adapt well to changing environments. Integrity safeguards that data remains consistent, accurate, and trustworthy across its lifecycleâ€”from ingestion and processing to storage and consumption. Without robust data quality and integrity practices, organizations risk introducing bias, inaccuracies, compliance violations, and operational inefficiencies into their AI initiatives, ultimately undermining the business value AI is intended to deliver.

### Definitions


1. Data Quality for AI-ready data refers to the degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, timely, relevant, and fit for use in training, validating, and deploying AI models.

2. Data Integrity refers to the assurance that data remains authentic, reliable, and unaltered throughout its lifecycle, with robust mechanisms for traceability, auditability, and protection against corruption or unauthorized modifications.
