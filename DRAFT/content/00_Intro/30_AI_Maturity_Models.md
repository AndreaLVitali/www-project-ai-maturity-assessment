## AI Maturity Models

In recent months, several AI Maturity Models have emerged, reflecting growing industry recognition of structured frameworks for managing AI-related risks and opportunities. Notable examples include:

- **MITRE AI Framework**, emphasizing the importance of structured assessments and comprehensive risk management across AI systems.
- **Gartner AI Maturity Model**, providing insights into organizational readiness, strategic alignment, and capability development for AI adoption.
- **Microsoft AI Maturity Model**, focusing on maturity dimensions like strategy, governance, and technical implementation.

The **OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA)** stands apart through its distinctive characteristics:

- **Community Vision:** Rather than advocating a proprietary perspective, OWASP fosters a collaborative, community-driven framework informed by diverse global expertise.
- **Open Participation:** OWASP encourages open contributions from organizations, experts, and individuals worldwide, facilitating continuous evolution and relevance.
- **De Facto Standard:** With its open and inclusive approach, AIMA aims to become a widely recognized and adopted standard, guiding organizations across sectors toward secure and responsible AI implementation.

OWASP AIMA seeks to establish itself as the premier open-source methodology enabling organizations to assess, analyze, and enhance their security posture and responsible usage of AI technologies. Following OWASP SAMMâ€™s proven model, AIMA remains technology- and process-agnostic, offering a risk-based approach to responsibly managing AI systems throughout their complete lifecycle.
