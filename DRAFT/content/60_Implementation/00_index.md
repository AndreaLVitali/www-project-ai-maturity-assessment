# Implementation

### Introduction  

The **Implementation** pillar ensures secure and resilient development practices specifically tailored for AI systems. Unlike traditional software development, AI implementation involves managing dynamic model-training processes, complex datasets, and model artifacts that present unique vulnerabilities and risks.

This pillar emphasizes three key practices:

1. **Secure Build** – Embedding secure coding practices and robust data-handling standards throughout AI model training, validation, and integration.

2. **Secure Deployment** – Ensuring AI models and infrastructure are deployed securely, with protections against unauthorized access, tampering, or misuse.

3. **Defect Management** – Systematically identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities and defects unique to AI models, datasets, and associated infrastructures.
