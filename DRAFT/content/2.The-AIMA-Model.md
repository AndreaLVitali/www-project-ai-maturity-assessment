## 2. The AIMA Model

The AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) model is designed to provide a structured framework for organizations to evaluate and improve their AI systems across all stages of their lifecycle. It emphasizes a holistic approach, focusing on governance, design, implementation, verification, and operation, ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly and effectively. By addressing critical aspects such as ethics, security, transparency, and accountability, the AIMA model helps organizations align their AI initiatives with both regulatory requirements and societal values.

At its core, the AIMA model is adaptable to organizations of all sizes and AI maturity levels, offering clear benchmarks and practical guidance. It is designed to bridge the gap between high-level principles and actionable practices, enabling organizations to manage AI-related risks while fostering innovation. By integrating global best practices, standards, and interdisciplinary insights, the AIMA model equips organizations to navigate the complexities of AI responsibly and sustainably, ensuring that AI systems are not only effective but also ethical and secure.

Building upon the foundation laid by the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), AIMA adapts SAMM's principles to address the unique challenges posed by AI systems.

Each function in SAMM includes defined security practices with maturity levels to guide organizations in improving their software security posture.

AIMA adapts this structure to the AI context, ensuring that each function addresses AI-specific considerations:

### Governance
* Strategy & Metrics: Developing AI strategies aligned with organizational objectives and establishing metrics to measure AI initiatives' effectiveness.
* Policy & Compliance: Ensuring AI systems comply with relevant laws, regulations, and ethical standards.
* Education & Guidance: Providing training and resources to stakeholders on responsible AI usage and governance.

### Design
* Threat Assessment: Identifying potential threats specific to AI systems, including adversarial attacks and data poisoning.
* Security Requirements: Defining security requirements tailored to AI applications to mitigate identified risks.
* Secure Architecture: Designing AI systems with robust security architectures that incorporate principles like least privilege and defense in depth.
  
### Implementation
* Secure Build: Implementing secure coding practices specific to AI development, including handling of training data and model parameters.
* Defect Management: Establishing processes to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in AI models and associated codebases.
* Security Testing: Conducting specialized testing methodologies for AI systems, such as adversarial testing and model robustness evaluation.

### Verification
* Architecture Assessment: Regularly reviewing AI system architectures to ensure they meet security and ethical standards.
* Requirements-driven Testing: Validating that AI systems fulfill defined security and functionality requirements through comprehensive testing.
* Security Testing: Performing ongoing security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities in AI systems.

### Operations
* Incident Management: Establishing protocols to respond to security incidents involving AI systems, including data breaches and model exploits.
* Environment Management: Maintaining secure and controlled environments for AI system deployment and operation.
* Operational Management: Overseeing the day-to-day functioning of AI systems to ensure they operate securely and as intended.
