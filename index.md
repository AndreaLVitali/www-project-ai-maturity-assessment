With the growing interest and adoption of AI technologies, it's critical to establish a framework that organizations can use to measure and enhance their AI maturity levels.

In recent months, several AI Maturity Models have emerged, including the MITRE AI Framework, which highlights the need for structured AI assessments. Building on this momentum, we are developing the OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA), using the Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) as a foundation.

The AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) project empowers organizations to navigate the complexities of artificial intelligence by providing a structured framework for making informed decisions about acquiring or developing AI systems. As AI continues to revolutionize industries, organizations face critical decisions about integrating these technologies responsibly. AIMA helps them evaluate AI systems' alignment with ethical principles, security standards, and operational goals while mitigating risks and ensuring long-term sustainability.

By bridging the gap between high-level AI principles and actionable implementation strategies, AIMA ensures that organizations not only adopt AI systems that align with their strategic objectives but also foster trust and accountability in their AI initiatives.

### Road Map
Phase 1: Initial Draft and Community Engagement (Jan-Feb 2025)

* Set up a dedicated team to support the development and promotion of AIMA.
* Launch team engagement initiatives to gather input and foster brainstorming sessions, driving collective feedback on the initial draft.
* Publish the first draft of the core project framework. This will outline the vision, mission, and foundational structure of AIMA.

Phase 2: Framework Development and Pilot Testing (March-May 2025)

* Refine the initial draft based on community feedback, and develop a more detailed framework covering the key areas of AI Governance.
* Initiate pilot testing with a selection of organizations to validate the framework's effectiveness and gather real-world insights.
* Expand community outreach to build partnerships and secure contributions from industry experts.

Phase 3: Presentation and Outreach at OWASP Conferences (June 2025)

* Finalize the initial version of the AIMA framework, incorporating feedback and insights from pilot testing.
* Present the AIMA framework at OWASP Conferences to reach a broader audience, share findings, and gather further input.
* Host workshops and panel discussions at the conferences to engage with security professionals, AI practitioners, and stakeholders, promoting broader adoption and community involvement.
